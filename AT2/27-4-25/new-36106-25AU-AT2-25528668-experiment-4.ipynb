strongest performance of all models evaluated in this project, clearly outperforming previous approaches such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN. On the training set, the model achieved exceptional scores across all evaluation metrics: 98.8% accuracy, 98.9% precision, 98.8% recall, and an F1-score of 98.8%. On the test set, the model continued to perform remarkably well, achieving 93.5% accuracy, 94.0% precision, 93.5% recall, and a weighted F1-score of 93.6%. The small gap between training and test performance suggests that the model is well-generalized and does not suffer from overfitting.\n","\n","The class-wise performance, visualized in the confusion matrix, further confirms the model's reliability. **Class 0 (Good)** was predicted with high accuracy, with 16 out of 18 instances correctly classified and only 2 misclassified as Class 2. **Class 1 (Average)** achieved perfect classification, with all 4 instances correctly identified. **Class 2 (Excellent)** also saw perfect prediction, with all 12 instances correctly classified, demonstrating that the model has successfully learned the distinguishing features for high-performing students. **Class 3 (Poor)** was also handled exceptionally well, with 26 out of 28 instances correctly predicted, and only minor misclassifications into Class 0.\n","\n","The confusion matrix shows minimal off-diagonal entries, indicating very few misclassifications across all classes. This is a substantial improvement over previous models, where specific classes—particularly Class 1 and Class 2—suffered from low recall or precision due to earlier issues with class imbalance and insufficient model complexity.\n","\n","These results strongly affirm the effectiveness of the XGBoost model in this context. Its ability to balance regularization, depth, and learning rate, combined with ensemble learning and feature subsampling, allows it to capture nuanced relationships in the data. This makes it a powerful candidate for deployment in real-world educational settings where accurately identifying student performance levels is essential.\n","\n","In summary, XGBoost not only outperformed all prior models but also demonstrated consistent, robust, and interpretable performance across both training and test sets.
