On the training set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.471, a weighted precision of 0.416, recall of 0.471, and an F1-score of 0.424. On the test set, the accuracy slightly increased to 0.484, with a precision of 0.454, recall of 0.484, and an F1-score of 0.436. The narrow gap between train and test scores indicates that the model is not overfitting, but the overall predictive performance remains limited.\n","\n","Class-wise, performance varied significantly. **Class 3 (Poor)** was predicted most effectively, achieving a precision of 0.548 and recall of 0.821, leading to an F1-score of 0.657. The confusion matrix (see \"Confusion Matrix - Logistic Regression (Test Set)\") shows that 23 out of 28 Class 3 instances were correctly predicted, with minimal confusion. In contrast, **Class 0 (Good)** suffered heavily from misclassification. Out of 18 actual instances, only 2 were correctly predicted, and 13 were incorrectly labeled as Class 3. This resulted in a precision of 0.222, recall of just 0.111, and a low F1-score of 0.148.\n","\n","**Class 1 (Average)** had perfect precision at 1.000 but only a recall of 0.250, meaning the model predicted this class very conservatively—correctly identifying just 1 out of 4 instances. **Class 2 (Excellent)** showed a balanced but modest result with precision at 0.400, recall at 0.333, and F1-score at 0.364. These metrics reflect the model’s limited ability to differentiate between the more nuanced classes, despite the dataset being balanced using SMOTE and numerically standardized.\n","\n","The confusion matrix visually supports these observations, particularly the strong concentration of misclassified Class 0 and Class 2 instances into Class 3. The model appears to lean toward predicting Class 3, which may reflect lingering class dominance patterns or a lack of strong distinguishing features for other classes.\n","\n","In conclusion, while Logistic Regression remains a valuable baseline due to its simplicity and interpretability, its linear nature constrains its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

On the training set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.471, a weighted precision of 0.416, recall of 0.471, and an F1-score of 0.424. On the test set, the accuracy slightly increased to 0.484, with a precision of 0.454, recall of 0.484, and an F1-score of 0.436.
